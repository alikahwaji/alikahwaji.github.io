        <p class="blog-text"><strong>What 'scope' is, and how it works in JavaScript?</strong><br> In JavaScript, scope refers to the current context of your code. Scopes can be globally or locally defined. Understanding JavaScript scope is key to writing bulletproof code
          and being a better developer. You’ll understand where variables/functions are accessible, be able to change the scope of your code’s context and be able to write faster and more maintainable code, as well as debug much faster. As well as variable
          scope, JavaScript uses the this keyword to get a reference to the current execution context. That rather terrifying term boils down this: at any point in your JavaScript code, you can ask “Help! Where am I?” and get back an object reference.
          This reference is for the current context, the object that “owns” the currently executing code.
