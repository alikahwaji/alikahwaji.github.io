        <h2>The analogy  of HTML, CSS and DOM</h2>
        <hr /> We can think of the HTML , CSS and DOM here like building a treehouse, where the HTML is the frame of that beautiful tree house but wait... we need a plan or a drawing that can help us with our ideas and design to follow? well lucky us we have
        the DOM which pretty much like a design plan. So after all the design plan and building in the end we want to put the last touches of color, style inside and who's better than CSS to do that.

        <h2> The boxifying power</h2>
        <hr /> Boxifying design (technique) is putting each element of the html structure in box , this will give the developer a better visualisation how to set up his web page.

        <h2> Box Model</h2>
        <hr /> All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and
        the actual content.
