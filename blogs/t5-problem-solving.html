        <p class="blog-text"><strong>Got blocked on a simple problem</strong><br>I was facing big time trouble with the online edtior on codeAcademy during the JS tutorials last week. I knew it was somthing not that hard to solve, then I learend somthing called "Loading order"
          which successfully helped me go through the tutorials.<br>
          <br><strong>Solved a problem in an elegant way</strong><br>I was doing one of the codeAcademy tutorials, I really wanted to code with nested functions and loops, creating a function within another function changes the scope of the function in
          the same way it would change the scope of a variable. This is especially important for use with closures to reduce total global namespace pollution.
          <br>
          <br><strong>My confidence level in using the following problem solving techniques and processes:</strong><br> Pseudocode,I have used it a couple of times and I might be learning more about by doing more coding on it. Trying something or learning
          somthing I have going through it will reading others code and trying to improve it or reading about a problem sulotion and appling to my code errors. Rubber ducky method, I read about before months ago and find it quit useful but for me solving
          math problems or walking away from my laptop for a while helps me to re-group my thoughts and code again. Reading error messages, I find it very useful and it can solve maybe 50% of problem but the challenge is sometime is quit complicated.
          Console logging, it is very good as checking my code for any line if I feel it's no right. very useful and an important piece of our code. Googling, I do use it to read more about any topic of programming and know what I'm missing during my
          bootcamp and what is the up to date sultions for programming. Asking peers for help, not that much I reach out for help from my peers, it gives me a feeling that I'm getting shortcuts during my learning and doing my own challenges but it does
          not mean I totally don't ask for help, I do but not always. Asking coaches for help, I do ask for help from them but also not always as I like searching for solving the problem myself but if I get to the point that I run out of options then
          YES! I will ask. Improving process with reflection, as part of this course, I feel it's very improtant on the personal side especially during this bootcamp.

          <br><strong> Explain to your non-tech friend
Using the JS Array docs as a starting point, describe what these functions do in your own words:</strong><br>The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element. The filter() method creates an array filled
          with all array elements that pass a test (provided as a function). The reduce() method executes a provided function for each value of the array (from left-to-right).
