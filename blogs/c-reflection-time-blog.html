          <br><strong>What are your impressions?</strong><br>As for my impression of EDA it was based on the feedback I found on the net as well as good feedbacks from people who attend the EDA bootcamp.
          <br>
          <br><strong>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</strong><br> The thing that I will be waiting to do is to meet my cohort start this journey together learning from them and to share the knowledge we learn My expectations
          of EDA the same and hoping it will continue the same.
          <br>
          <br><strong>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</strong><br>Watching Shreef's video was a good example for me to see how find my goal in this bootcamp, the type of examples he gave we can apply it during our studies in EDA. The
          type of environment that EDA gives me a motivation to do more in developing web.
          <br>
          <br><strong>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</strong><br>
          <br><strong>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</strong><br> I'm excited to start learning and working in team with the rest of my classmates in this environment of web development.
          I have met people who have graduated from EDA and got positive feedback about the learning enviroment of EDA. Dose this makes me nervous? kinda off but I hope I will overcome this type of feeling and try to put good work on the table.<br>

        <p class="blog-text"><strong>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</strong><br><br>The leason that I got from 'midnfulness conversation' is to use more of it's listing techniques while having an conversation to
          be listening fully one must actively when the other is speaking, and also to engage others by asking questions to show our interest in the topic.
          <br><strong>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</strong><br>“Take one breath a day”, I fint the technique very useful and effective, it really helps me to keep on with practice and sustain it more.

        <p class="blog-text"><strong>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</strong><br><br>With mindfulness helps to increase our awareness of emotions. This increase of awareness helps to evaluate our weak ponits and try to focus more on it. Once
          we acknowledge that we will be more confident and aware of our bodies.
          <br><br><strong>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</strong><br><br>Did both and the body scan was very calming and relaxing, giving you
          more deep connection. Journalling is yet an interesting technique and practcing it gives a good feeling, it helps alot with personal growth and development.
          <br><br><strong>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</strong><br><br>I learned that the transformation happens in our feelings not bodies, meaning instead of using "I am" I learnd that "I feel" shows my state of
          emotion.<br>

        <p class="blog-text"><strong>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</strong><br><br>When I am not sure of what the waffle card is,or where I am can not find the solution of the problem. Even when my code I wrote shows many errors .All this causes frustration for me and not getting anywhere with my task.
          <br><br><strong>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</strong><br><br>When getting triggered I will stop, leave my laptop and try this technique and it helps me a lot. The level of my frustration will go down, the heavy breathing in my chest will be less and I will take deep breaths. It makes me very calm amd focused.

        <p class="blog-text"><strong>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</strong><br><br>Pleasure: In any way you “party” and experience pleasure, it has been shown that out of the three types of happiness this is the most fleeting and short
          lasting and “as soon as the source of stimuli goes away, people’s pleasure drops immediately”. Passion: passion is surfing and being out in nature along with a few other things like reading, journaling, and more. Higher Purpose: serving a higher
          purpose and feeling connected to something larger and more powerful than yourself. Of course, is this the “highest” form of happiness and also the longest lasting.
          <br><br><strong>What are your core values, and what do you stand for?</strong><br><br>I have found myself getting off course and compromising on my core values. When this occurs, I always get less than pleasing results, regardless of what the
          category is. Wether it be relationships, business, health, family or career areas. When I get in alignment with my values at the core level – all areas of my life are in harmony.
          <br><br><strong>How were the resilience ideas and meditation exercises?</strong><br><br>Ideas behaind it are useful because it divides fundamentals into peace of mind both emotional & cognitive resilience, I found cognitive reslience very useful
          for me.It is defined as an individual's ability to successfully adapt to life tasks in the face of social disadvantage or highly adverse conditions. Adversity and stress can come in the shape of family or relationship problems, health problems,
          or workplace and financial worries, among others. <br><br>

        <p class="blog-text"><strong>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</strong><br><br> Didn't have the chance to practice any of the insight and techniques but I kept trying to give to the people around
          me, I will be trying these techniques and practicing them more while attending my next phase here in EDA.
          <br><br><strong>Try empathic listening - how did it go?
</strong><br><br>Trying the empathic listening was good and it really helped me develop good understanding with person I'm communcate with, the most important part is not rushing to answer and asking clarifying questions to have a better understanding
          of the topic.
          <br><br><strong>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?
</strong><br><br>It's a beautiful practice which it teach us how to be thankful for pepole around and espacilly those who care about us and makes us more loved, so it's only fare to acknowledged that by send them back the same love and sharing to make
          them feel happy.<br><br>
