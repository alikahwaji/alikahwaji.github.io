          <br><strong>What are your impressions?</strong><br>As for my impression of EDA it was based on the feedback I found on the net as well as good feedbacks from people who attend the EDA bootcamp.
          <br>
          <br><strong>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</strong><br> The thing that I will be waiting to do is to meet my cohort start this journey together learning from them and to share the knowledge we learn My expectations
          of EDA the same and hoping it will continue the same.
          <br>
          <br><strong>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</strong><br>Watching Shreef's video was a good example for me to see how find my goal in this bootcamp, the type of examples he gave we can apply it during our studies in EDA. The
          type of environment that EDA gives me a motivation to do more in developing web.
          <br>
          <br><strong>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</strong><br>
          <br><strong>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</strong><br> I'm excited to start learning and working in team with the rest of my classmates in this environment of web development.
          I have met people who have graduated from EDA and got positive feedback about the learning enviroment of EDA. Dose this makes me nervous? kinda off but I hope I will overcome this type of feeling and try to put good work on the table.<br>
